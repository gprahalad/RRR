# Heading 1 {#heading-link}

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### References
And we can compare the size of the smallest heading to plain text.

**Using two asterisks or two underscores on either side makes text bold.**

There must be a space between lines otherwise they will join together.

*A single asterisk or underscore on either side makes text italicized*

Putting numbers between two carrots like ^100^ makes it superscript while putting it between two ~tildes~ makes it subscript.

The number of empty lines between lines does not equate to actual empty lines as these need to be specificed using a backslash,
\
\
\
\
like so.

[Putting text in square brackets followed by a tag in parenthesis is an internal hyperlink](#heading-link)

[Or you can use the same syntax to link to an external address](https://www.sanger.ac.uk)

You can put in footnotes by using square brackets[^1] 

[^1]: and defining the footnote elsewhere in the document

#### Ordered lists

1. Lists can be 
2. made ordered
3. by numbering them.
    a. They can even have
    b. sublists by using double-tab.
4. For different items
    i. you can use roman numerals as well
    
#### Unordered lists

* Asterisk can be
* used for bullet points
    * and similar structure
    * can be used for subpoints.
* Switching between 
    a. ordered and unordered
    b. is also possible.
